# Bloqel #
---

Bloqel (pronounced "blockle") is a simple voxel engine. Bloqel is written in C++17 and is designed to abstract away voxel-based details, allowing for better modularity and separation of concerns.

## Building  ##
Building is relatively simple:

    git clone https://github.com/jmcph4/bloqel.git
    cd bloqel
    make
    make docs # if you would like Doxygen documentation

This will produce a dynamically-linked library in `build/` called `libbloqel.so`. Windows build instructions coming soon.

## Contributing ##
Contribution instructions coming soon.
